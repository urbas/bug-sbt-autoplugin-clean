This project reproduces a potential SBT bug.

The tests in this project are failing: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/urbas/bug-sbt-autoplugin-clean.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/urbas/bug-sbt-autoplugin-clean)

The tests verify that a file generated by an SBT AutoPlugin is deleted in the `clean` task.

The AutoPlugin configures cleaning by adding the generated file to the `cleanFiles` list (see [source code](src/main/scala/si/urbas/sbt/CleanAutoPluginBug.scala#L22)).

However, the file is not deleted after calling clean (see [failing tests](src/sbt-test/autoplugin-must-clean/simple/test#L5)).
